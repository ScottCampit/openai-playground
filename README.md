This repository contains some code snippets that use the Open AI API to perform various tasks.

## Toy Chatbot
To use the toy chatbot, you first need to create a virtual environment using the libraries in `requirements.txt`. This can be done by running the following command:

```
python3 -m venv chatbot_env
source chatbot_env/bin/activate
```

Then run the following command to run the Streamlit application:

```
streamlit run toy_chatbot.py
```
